    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p id="main">
      I'm an aspiring developer who is currently in the coding bootcamp. I've
      been in the medical field for most of my life, so coding is entirely new
      for me. Though I always had a passion for software development. As a new developer I want to develop user friendly healthcare application.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p id="education">
      All the schooling I did was related to medical field too. My goal is to
      become a skillful software developer in this year.
    </p>

      classes when I was in college and actually considered to become part-time
      photographer.
